# Mid term exam solve for wireless 2021 spring 

Do you know the secrete of your student id? Your student id has some inner meaning. For
example, one student having this student id (182-15-12345). Every number separated by the
hyphen (-) has some special meaning. Let me explain you one by one. The first portion contains
182. The first two digits (18) indicates in which year a student has admitted and the last digit (2)
indicates the semester. So, 182 means a student has admitted into DIU in summer 2018. Now
come to the second portion, which contains 15. This is the code of the department of CSE. Every
department in DIU has a unique department code. Moreover, the last portion contains 12345, is
the student number of that student. Department Codes and Semester mapping are given below.
Now your job is to design an android application which will contain two activities
named StartActivity and InfoActivity. In the StartActivity, you will have three EditText
components and a button. First EditText component will suggest entering your Name, the
second one will suggest entering your student id (as string), and the third one will suggest you
to entering your mobile number (as string). The button will be named as the “Go to Next” button.
If you press the “Go to Next” button, you will be moved to the InfoActivity. Before going to the
InfoActivity, it will pass your name, student id, and mobile number from the EditText
components. The InfoActivity will contain one button named “Process Info” button and a
TextView. After pressing the Process Info button, it will do some work in the background with
the data it received from the StartActivity and show some text in the TextView. It will analyze the
mobile number that has received from the StartActivity. Based on the last digit of the mobile
number it will analyze the student id and show a message in the TextView. Samples are given
below.
